# dotNet-Easy-XSplit-and-OBS-Plugins

I've provided many different examples of ways you could make plugins, including all the source. It should be able to be expanded with other engines. OpenTK is one of the most barebones because it's essentially just C# OpenGL bindings, which is a graphics library only. As long as you can create an array of 4 byte colors you should be able to adapt your own libraries for the plugin.

-External DLLS
  CLRHost.Interop; Required for the OBS plugin support, source can be found at https://github.com/kc5nra/CLRHostPlugin
  VHMediaCOM.dll; Included when you install XSplit.

-End User Standalone Setup:
  That defeats the purpose of this thing entirely.. but ok. They should just be able to run a standalone version of the program and then chroma key out a certain color that doesn't change, or is customizeable.

-End User XSplit Setup:
  Drag the .XBS file into any scene you wish the plugin to run. Run the .exe for it to send graphical data to XSplit. The .exe needs to run for the plugin to work. (I would advise giving the option to run the .exe in headless mode, since you don't actually need a window to render to, as long as you are rendering out to a texture behind the scenes.)

-End User OBS Setup:
  Download and install CLRHostPlugin if you haven't already (make sure you install the 32 or 64 bit version in the correct spot, whichever version you're using). You should extract CLRHostPlugin into the /OBS/plugins/ directory, so that /OBS/plugins/CLRHostPlugin/ can be used. Extract the entirety of the bin folder into the CLRHostPlugin directory. Including DLLS and any other content needed to run. Then you just need to launch OBS and add the plugin to the scene. OBS doesn't require you to run the .exe externally if the plugin itself can launch everything the application needs to render.
